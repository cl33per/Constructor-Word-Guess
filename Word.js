// Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. That means the constructor should define:

//An array of `new` Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word

//A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in `Letter.js`) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.

//A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in `Letter.js`)
// var Letter = require("./Letter.js");
// Defining constructor of Word...
// function Word (){

// };

// Saving Word to a protoype...
// Word.prototype.toSrting = function(){

// }

// Exporting the Word constructor which we will use in index.js
// module.exports = Word;
